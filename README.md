This project aims to analyze and compare the performance of the Fama-French 3-factor (FF3) and 5-factor (FF5) models in explaining stock returns.  The objective is to evaluate whether the addition of the two additional factors (CMA and RMW) improves, decreases or does not affect the performance of the model in terms of explaining stock returns.
